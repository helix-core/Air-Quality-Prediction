# Air-Quality-Prediction
Air Quality Prediction using Random Forest Regressor: This project aims to predict air quality levels using machine learning techniques. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained to forecast air quality indexes, based on real-time air quality index measurement which is fed as a dataset.
